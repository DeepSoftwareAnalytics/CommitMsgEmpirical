Skipping setting preload attribute and events on an audio tag on mobile devices
misc view . js OCD
Publish
When setting a global volume for the SoundManager it would previously incorrectly calculate the volumes of AudioTag based Sound objects that were not played at volume 1 . The new approach uses Sound . updateGlobalVolume which adjusts the Sound volume to be a percentage of the global volume . So if the global volume is 0 . 5 and the Sound volume is 0 . 5 , the Sound will play with an actual volume of 0 . 25 ( thanks @ VitaZheltyakov )

Pointer button handling has been given an overhaul . It has the following new boolean properties : ` leftButton ` , ` rightButton ` , ` middleButton ` , ` backButton ` , ` forwardButton ` and ` eraserButton ` . So you can now easily check which buttons are active and build right or middle click support into your games . The Pointer object normalises these properties for you , regardless if they came from a MouseEvent or PointerEvent ( thanks @ youssefdetovernickr for the idea )

[ BUGFIX ] modules docs for tryInvoke , compare , isEqual
Clean up a little bit and make current existing unit test run again
Group . align is a new method that allows you to layout all the children of the Group in a grid formation . You can specify the dimensions of the grid , including the width , height and cell size . You can also control where children are positioned within each grid cell . The grid width and height values can also be set to - 1 , making them fluid , so the grid expands until all children are aligned . Finally an optional child index argument can be set . This is a great way to quickly and comprehensively align Group children , and has lots of use cases .

Added check for res . headersSent before attempting to send a response due to the session middleware triggering its callback with an error .

Since recovery is possible here , and _some_ sort of response has obviously been sent , it ' s preferable to keep the process alive in this scenario .
