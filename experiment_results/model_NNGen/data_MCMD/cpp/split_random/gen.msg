Refactor the way output is handled in CommandLineInterface - - now it will be stored in - memory until all code generators have completed , then dumped to disk all at once . While this means that protoc uses more memory , the code is much simpler , and handles insertions much faster . Also , this made it easier to implement a useful feature : insertions will be indented to match the insertion point line . Therefore , when inserting into Python code , you don ' t have to figure out how much to indent your inserted code . The refactoring should also make it easier to implement output - to - jar at some point .

Export the TF Session classes and functions from C + + to Python with pybind11 instead of swig . This is part of a larger effort to deprecate swig and eventually with modularization break pywrap_tensorflow into smaller components . It will also make exporting C + + ops to Python significantly easier . XLA is using the pybind11 macros already . Please refer to https : / / github . com / tensorflow / community / blob / master / rfcs / 20190208 - pybind11 . md for more information .

Fix the handling of uniform arrays in the GL interop layer . In GL , arrays of uniforms need to have consecutive locations , i . e . array [ x ] is at location array [ 0 ] + x . The uniform mapping table mechanism in library_gl . js did not take into account that user could do int loc = getUniformLocation ( " array [ 0 ] " ) and then call glUniform3fv ( loc + 2 , data ) . In the fix , uniforms are mapped so that arrays will be guaranteed to get consecutive locations .

Code optimization .
Refactor the way output is handled in CommandLineInterface - - now it will be stored in - memory until all code generators have completed , then dumped to disk all at once . While this means that protoc uses more memory , the code is much simpler , and handles insertions much faster . Also , this made it easier to implement a useful feature : insertions will be indented to match the insertion point line . Therefore , when inserting into Python code , you don ' t have to figure out how much to indent your inserted code . The refactoring should also make it easier to implement output - to - jar at some point .

Refactor the way output is handled in CommandLineInterface - - now it will be stored in - memory until all code generators have completed , then dumped to disk all at once . While this means that protoc uses more memory , the code is much simpler , and handles insertions much faster . Also , this made it easier to implement a useful feature : insertions will be indented to match the insertion point line . Therefore , when inserting into Python code , you don ' t have to figure out how much to indent your inserted code . The refactoring should also make it easier to implement output - to - jar at some point .
