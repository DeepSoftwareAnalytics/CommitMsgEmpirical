Large rewrite / refactor from the page format outward .

New implementation for in - page cursors to use a per - page arena and share decoded binary tree nodes between cursors in the same page . New implementation for internal record B + Tree cursor which uses reference counted path hops which makes cloning a cursor very cheap . New implementation of external facing B + Tree cursor which makes efficient use of two internal cursors to find user - visible KV pairs and return them without copying keys and values except in the case of a large sharded value .

really commit
Refactor the way output is handled in CommandLineInterface - - now it will be stored in - memory until all code generators have completed , then dumped to disk all at once . While this means that protoc uses more memory , the code is much simpler , and handles insertions much faster . Also , this made it easier to implement a useful feature : insertions will be indented to match the insertion point line . Therefore , when inserting into Python code , you don ' t have to figure out how much to indent your inserted code . The refactoring should also make it easier to implement output - to - jar at some point .

Major usability and performance improvements to backup management . Backup descriptions now calculate and display timestamps using TimeKeeper data ( if given a cluster ) and restorability of snapshots . Expire now requires a - - force option to leave a backup unrestorable or unrestorable after a given point in time , specified by version or timestamp . BackupContainerFilesystem now maintains metadata on key version boundaries in order to avoid large list operations for describe and expire operations . Blob parallel recursive list operations can now take a path ( aka prefix ) filter function . New describe and expire options are available in fdbbackup .

IBackupContainer has been rewritten to be a logical interface for storing , reading , deleting , expiring , and querying backup data . The details of how the data is organized or stored is now hidden from users of the interface . Both the local and blobstore containers have been rewritten , the key changes being a multi level directory structure and no more use of temporary files or pseudo - symlinks in the blob store implementation . This refactor has a large impact radius as the previous backup container was just a thin wrapper that presented a single level list of files and offered no methods for managing or interpreting the file structure so all of that logic was spread around other places in the code base . This made moving to the new blob store schema very messy , and without this refactor further changes in the future would only be worse .

Doc : Update isStandardTx comment
Refactor the dialect conversion framework to support multi - level conversions . Multi - level conversions are those that require multiple patterns to be applied before an operation is completely legalized . This essentially means that conversion patterns do not have to directly generate legal operations , and may be chained together to produce legal code .

Introduce move construction and move assignment just so everyone gets a simple introduction to the subject . These are nothing but optimizations of the copy constructor and copy assignment . They only get called with the rhs is an rvalue . The lhs gets the value of the rhs , and the rhs can get set to any valid value . If the resulting operation isn ' t faster than a copy , then the move member should just be removed so the copy member can take over . For string the move members are likely to be only very slightly faster . I ' m attempting to avoid atomics and branches in the move members , though there is one branch and one atomic decrement in the move assignment operator .

fix : forced recoveries now require a target dcid which will become the new primary location . During the forced recovery , the configuration will be changed to make that location primary , and usable_regions will be set to 1 . If the target dcid is already the primary location , the forced recovery will do nothing . This makes forced recoveries idempotent , so it is safe to the client to re - send forced recovery commands to the cluster controller .
