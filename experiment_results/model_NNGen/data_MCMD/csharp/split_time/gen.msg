In case of async void methods we also emit the offset of the catch handler to PDB , so that the debugger can pretend that exceptions thrown by the async method are unhandled .

Added lazy RefCount operator for IObservables . Lazy RefCount connects like RefCount but may delay disconnection . This is useful whenever a lot of connect / disconnect cycles are expected within a short timespan but with a significant overhead in connecting / disconnecting . Some unit tests have been added . Lazy RefCount has been excluded from methods that must be present for Qbservable as well . I leave it up to others to decide what Lazy RefCount means for Qbservable and whether there should be an implementation . ( )
