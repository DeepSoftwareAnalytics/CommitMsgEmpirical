Rename HttpServerRequest # upgrade to HttpServerRequest # toWebSocket and make it asynchronous in order to buffer the HTTP request body that is necessary to perform the WebSocket upgrade . Previously this buffering was done in the internal Http1xServerRequestHandler with a downside : upgrade requests are buffered and when delivered to a request handler instead of a WebSocket handler , then this handler will not get any HTTP events as those are already consumed to buffer the request body . Now the request handler will receive upgrade requests when the HTTP headers are received and can either set its own handler to handle the data or call toWebSocket to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket . - close

[ GR - 7256 ] Notify the return value of UnexpectedResultException .
Change profiling to only accept strings for its " description " argument . Profiling can hold onto objects for the duration of the build , and some of those objects may be temporary that should not be persisted . In particular , UnixGlob and its inner classes should not outlive loading and analysis . For the most part , care was taken in this CL to only use strings that required no additional construction , mainly to minimize garbage ( retaining references to newly created strings is not as great a concern since only the strings corresponding to the slowest K tasks are retained , for some relatively small values of K ) . Action descriptions for actually executing actions are eagerly expanded because that work is minimal compared to the work of actually executing an action .

- proxyInjection mode - - a global mode under which selenium JavaScript is injected into all incoming HTML . Because it is still uncertain whether this strategy will be viable , I haven ' t yet bothered to implement browser launchers which will configure the browser appropriately for this mode ; all traffic must go through the client configured proxy . The one change for the communications protocol is that newly loaded pages reporting in for the first time to the selenium server did not use to cause a command result to go on the queue , but with this change they do . This means that an operation which results in a new page being loaded , e . g . , Selenese open , will lead to a command result just like any other command .

Add the ability to reconstruct a BuildOptions from the diff with another BuildOptions .

JimEvans : Introduced the " requireWindowFocus " capability into the IE driver . When used in conjunction with the " nativeEvents " capability , the driver will attempt to bring the current IE window to the foreground before executing a mouse or keyboard event . Also , when the requireWindowFocus capability is set to true , advanced user interactions will now use the Windows SendInput ( ) API to execute the interactions . To enable this behavior , set the value of the requiresWindowFocus capability to " true " when creating an instance of the IE driver . The default for this new capability is " false " . This functionality is currently considered extremely experimental ; use at your own risk .

[ ci ] move - profiling : grep for the right benchmark counter file name
add travis ci
[ fixed ] Color . toFloatBits ( ) methods . Will half the precision of the alpha channel of 32 - bit rgba colors . Nothing i can do about it . Problem is that Java only has a single canonical NaN value . Using Float . intBitsToFloat ( ) will convert any signaling NaN to that canonical value , transforming colors like 0xfeaaeb3c to 0xfeeaeb3c . The fix just masks the 32 - bit int via 0xfeffffff before it is passed ot Color . toFloatBits ( ) effectively making it impossible to return canonical NaNs . This of course means that the least significant bit of the alpha component is always 0 , so you only have 128 alpha values really : p . Darn Java . Darn FPUs .

In TypesTest , change the check for correct functioning in the presence of a SecurityManager . Previously we had a SecurityManager that refused Method . setAccessible except in a few well - known places , the intent being that one of the places it would refuse would be the use in Types . TypeVariableInvocationHandler that we wanted to test . But that proved to be fragile . Instead , we explicitly refuse that place , and we check that the refusal happened . This builds more knowledge of the implementation into the test , but should be more robust .

JimEvans : Introduced the " requireWindowFocus " capability into the IE driver . When used in conjunction with the " nativeEvents " capability , the driver will attempt to bring the current IE window to the foreground before executing a mouse or keyboard event . Also , when the requireWindowFocus capability is set to true , advanced user interactions will now use the Windows SendInput ( ) API to execute the interactions . To enable this behavior , set the value of the requiresWindowFocus capability to " true " when creating an instance of the IE driver . The default for this new capability is " false " . This functionality is currently considered extremely experimental ; use at your own risk .

Make degree ( node ) on directed networks O ( 1 ) instead of O ( D ) , at the cost of a teensy bit of memory ( a self loop counter ) . In actuality it doesn ' t seem to take up any extra memory , perhaps due to how the object is padded / aligned . Additionally , this CL makes iterating through incidentEdges ( ) slightly faster on directed networks if no self - loops are present . In the undirected case , adding and removing self - loop edges is now slightly faster .

EranMes : Implementing the moveto command for Firefox . This implementation , while funtionally correct , is not optimal for two reasons : First , the current X , Y coordinates are not stored as a part of the session but on the firefoxDriver instance itself . Second , the current resolution for generating the mouse move events is too low which means the mouse cursor will not end up on the desired coordinates . Both issues will be attended in a follow - up changeset .

Unify AbstractBlazeQueryEnvironment # evaluateQuery with its subclass overrides . Also , have AbstractBlazeQueryEnvironment # evaluateQuery take an OutputFormatterCallback instance rather than a Callback instance . This is more sensible since the latter is only intended to be used intra - query , while the former is intended for usage in end - to - end query evaluation . This lets us slightly simplify QueryCommand , by shifting the responsibility for managing the OutputFormatterCallback to AbstractBlazeQueryEnvironment # evaluateQuery .
