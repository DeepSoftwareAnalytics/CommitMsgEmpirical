This invalidates the ` field ` field in previeous versions . The value these fields value is a ` geo_point ` value ( all formats supported ) which is internally translated to a geohash . Since those points alway have a maximum precision ( level 12 ) a ` precision ` definition has been included . This precision can either be defined as * length * of the geohash - string or as * distance * . It ' s assumed the a distance without any unit is a geohash - length .

DanielWagnerHall : Another bash at this scrolling bug . I don ' t like this commit for a number of reasons . There are no tests ( yet ) because the error condition is quite complex . It introduces an explicit bug , in that it will force scrolling a hidden element in to view , but that bug was already present ; this commit just means that we won ' t * also * force scroll the element in to view if it * is * already in view . Really , this whole thing should probably be pulled in to an atom , rather than adding to the ever - growing - complexity , and ill - tested bundle of the javascript - in - C - string - constants that is currently present . But hey , it works for now . For now .

[ FIXED HUDSON - 3028 ] in 1 . 319 . In a long run , I believe doing this control in the queue with ResourceController is better , because ( 1 ) scheduling one at a time can create unnecessary wait time - - - say if one of the configuration needs to run on a slave that ' s blocked , then it ' s better to schedule others first , and ( 2 ) the notion of shared resources spans beyond a single job , so doing that coordination at a job level isn ' t general enough . That said , I think it ' ll be easy enough to maintain data compatibility when this happens , so I ' m committing this change now .

JasonLeyba ( on behalf of MichaelTaylor ) : Wrap js eval commands in a CATransaction so that we can explicitly force any UI updates that might occur as a side effect of executing the javascript to finish rendering before we return control back to the HTTP server thread . We actually found some cases where the rendering was finishing before control returned and so the core animation framework would defer committing its implicit transaction until the next iteration of the HTTP server thread ' s run loop . However , because you ' re only allowed to update the UI on the main application thread , committing it on the HTTP server thread would cause the whole application to crash . This feels like it shouldn ' t be necessary but it was the only way we could find to avoid the problem .
this entry probably doesn ' t need the default description .

Truffle : add the ability to " tag " Sources with any number of standard or private tags , for example so that Sources might be marked as " FROM_FILE " , " LIBRARY " , " BUILTIN " , or any other distinction that matters to some tools . Those tags can be applied by the language runtime when sources are created , for example when loading builtins . Alternately , you can listen for newly created sources from outside the implementation , where you might tag sources based on pattern matching against file paths or any other meta - information in the Source .

EranMes : Linking libwebdriver - firefox . so ( 32 bit version ) on a 32 - bit machine not with the official gecko sdk led to libwebdriver - firefox . so depending on libnspr4 . so . 0d instead of libnspr4 . so . This causes a failure to load libwebdriver - firefox . so on 32 - bit systems without this so . Changed the Rakefile to link only with the official gecko sdk ( which exists in 32 bit version only ) and not to link to gtk libs - as it causes the build of the library to fail on 64 bit systems ( when cross compiling ) and is not needed anyway - Firefox is always linked with these libraries and it ' s best to use the symbols Firefox has loaded .
