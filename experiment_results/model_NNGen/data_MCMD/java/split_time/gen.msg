Change profiling to only accept strings for its " description " argument . Profiling can hold onto objects for the duration of the build , and some of those objects may be temporary that should not be persisted . In particular , UnixGlob and its inner classes should not outlive loading and analysis . For the most part , care was taken in this CL to only use strings that required no additional construction , mainly to minimize garbage ( retaining references to newly created strings is not as great a concern since only the strings corresponding to the slowest K tasks are retained , for some relatively small values of K ) . Action descriptions for actually executing actions are eagerly expanded because that work is minimal compared to the work of actually executing an action .

This lets us slightly simplify QueryCommand , by shifting the responsibility for managing the OutputFormatterCallback to AbstractBlazeQueryEnvironment # evaluateQuery .

Remove padding from large text for BottomNavigation to match small text . Guidance is to use short text in bottom navigation so this should not have a visual effect since the width of each item is equally divided with a max width ( in other words , the padding doesn ' t affect the width ) . However , when system font size is increased , even short text can be cut off by the padding and this gives a little more room for the text .

Change profiling to only accept strings for its " description " argument . Profiling can hold onto objects for the duration of the build , and some of those objects may be temporary that should not be persisted . In particular , UnixGlob and its inner classes should not outlive loading and analysis . For the most part , care was taken in this CL to only use strings that required no additional construction , mainly to minimize garbage ( retaining references to newly created strings is not as great a concern since only the strings corresponding to the slowest K tasks are retained , for some relatively small values of K ) . Action descriptions for actually executing actions are eagerly expanded because that work is minimal compared to the work of actually executing an action .
