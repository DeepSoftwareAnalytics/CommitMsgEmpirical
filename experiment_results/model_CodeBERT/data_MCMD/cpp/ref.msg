[ Diagnostics ] Diagnose assignment type mismatches related to unresolved members
Ensure that ' once ' objects are declared using the macro . This is either the third or fourth time I ' ve screwed this up when down - integrating , because our internal code does not require the macro ( it ' s not portable ) and on Linux a pthread_once_t that is zero - initialized just happens to work . So , I only discover the problem when I test on Mac , then kick myself for making the same mistake yet again . No more ! This time , I have renamed GoogleOnceType to ProtobufOnceType , thus making the type name differ from our internal code . As a result , if you don ' t update the decls to use the macros , they won ' t compile . Hah ! Take that , future self !

Simplify ruy ' s main loop . Most of the next_ * business was unnecessary complication . This code didn ' t know whether it wanted to hide latency of an atomic increment ( 60 cycles ) or of a block coords computation ( comparable ) . Now it ' s more intentional about hiding the atomic increment latency , because that ' s the one instruction here that will always have high latency ; for the rest , we can only hope that the compiler will exploit any opportunity to inline the block computation and distribute its instructions so as to hide some of the latency .

This CL implements the following behavior for stop_gradient in while loop gradient computation . Consider a while loop with inputs xs = ( x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) and outputs ys = ( y1 , y2 , . . . , yn ) . If all the ys are either stopped or not used , the entire while loop will be skipped in the gradient graph and the gradient for the xs will be None for downstream backprop . If there is a real gradient for any of the ys , we will backprop 0 for all the ys that are stopped or not used .
