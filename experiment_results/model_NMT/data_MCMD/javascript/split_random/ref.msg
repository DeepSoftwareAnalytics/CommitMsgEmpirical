The StateManager will now check if a State has a method called ` resize ` . If it does , and if the game is running in the RESIZE Scale Mode then this method will be called whenever the game resizes .

Tween . frameBased allows you to control if a Tween updates based on the physics step ( i . e . frame based ) or the system clock ( time based ) . A frame based tween will use the physics elapsed timer when updating . This means it will retain the same consistent frame rate , regardless of the speed of the device . The duration value given should be given in frames . If the Tween uses a time based update ( which is the default ) then the duration is given in milliseconds . In this situation a 2000ms tween will last exactly 2 seconds , regardless of the device and how many visual updates the tween has actually been through .

You can use the new const ` Phaser . PENDING_ATLAS ` as the texture key for any sprite . Doing this then sets the key to be the ` frame ` argument ( the frame is set to zero ) . This allows you to create sprites using ` load . image ` during development , and then change them to use a Texture Atlas later in development by simply searching your code for ' PENDING_ATLAS ' and swapping it to be the key of the atlas data .

website : Upgrade ` hexo - browsersync `
Merge pull request from styled - components / fn - attrs
Phaser . TilemapParser . INSERT_NULL is a new boolean that controls what happens when the parser encounters an empty tile : When scanning the Tiled map data the TilemapParser can either insert a null value ( true ) or a ` Phaser . Tile ` instance with an index of - 1 ( false , the default ) . Depending on your game type depends how this should be configured . If you ' ve a large sparsely populated map and the tile data doesn ' t need to change then setting this value to ` true ` will help with memory consumption . However if your map is small , or you need to update the tiles ( perhaps the map dynamically changes during the game ) then leave the default value set ( thanks )

docs : fix 404 link to vuex intro page ( )
ArcadePhysics . overlap has been updated so that the Body . overlapX / Y properties are set to the amount the two bodies overlapped by . Previously they were zero and only populated during the separation phase , but now the data is available for just overlap checks as well . You can then use these values in your ovrelap callback as required - note that they are changed for every check , so a Sprite overlap tested against 10 other sprites will have the overlapX / Y values updated 10 times in a single collision pass , so you can only safely use the values in the callback ( )

Groups now have the following properties , which are getters and setters : ` centerX ` , ` centerY ` , ` left ` , ` right ` , ` top ` and ` bottom ` . These calculate the bounds of the Group , based on all visible children , and then allow you to apply positioning based on that . This means you can , for example , now get the horizontal center of a Group by called ` Group . centerX ` . These properties are also setters , so you can position the Groups , and it will take scale and rotation into consideration .
