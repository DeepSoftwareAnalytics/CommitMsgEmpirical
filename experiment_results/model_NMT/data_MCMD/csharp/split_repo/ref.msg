Not all use cases need the enumeration here . Allowing the enumeration to be deferred here allows for chaining of expression tree projection ( i . e . DTO layer - > Entity layer - > SQL layer ( via EF ) ) . This is a really cool use case for this , but also means client programmers may get a couple bugs if they previously map to an ienumerable and rely on the automapper ' s enumeration call .

Avoid continuation leaks in TaskObservableExtensions . ToObservable . This is a bit more involved . The continuation must not be registered before a subscription happens because it might leak on long lived tasks . So instead of registering a continuation on a task once and forwarding the results to an AsyncSubject , we construct an Observable that registers the continuation for each subscription . Memory performance might of course go down if a lot of subscriptions happen on a task , but it won ' t leak .

Switch to ValueTask for predicates , selectors , etc . We await those ourselves and they are expected to be called in a high - frequency manner , so this seems to be the right choice . The only drawback is when these operators are used using method group conversion of a Task - returning async method , which is likely rare in query expressions where one typically uses ( async ) lambdas , and there ' s a workaround Task - to - ValueTask conversion . We can ' t overload on ValueTask and Task return types , so this seems the best way forward .

Added lazy RefCount operator for IObservables . Lazy RefCount connects like RefCount but may delay disconnection . This is useful whenever a lot of connect / disconnect cycles are expected within a short timespan but with a significant overhead in connecting / disconnecting . Some unit tests have been added . Lazy RefCount has been excluded from methods that must be present for Qbservable as well . I leave it up to others to decide what Lazy RefCount means for Qbservable and whether there should be an implementation . ( )
Renaming Omega operator fusion methods to Combine .
Skip ThreadPoolSchedulerTest . No_ThreadPool_Starvation_Dispose on CI . An equivalent test for DefaultScheduler is excluded already . The assertions made here is unjustifiable when tests are run in parallel and the ThreadPool is used by other concurrently running tests . An alternative would be to disable test parallelization completely .

Introduce a single place where all public async overloads are maintained to evaluate design options using a single SUPPORT_FLAT_ASYNC_API flag .
AsyncEnumerable . ToObservable : Do not call IAsyncEnumerator < T > . MoveNext with an already canceled CancellationToken . This would happen whenever an IObserver < T > . OnNext would dispose its subscription within a call to OnNext . The built in AnonymousAsyncEnumerator < T > checks whether it ' s already disposed , however , not every user code might handle canceled tokens that gracefully . Also , the continuation of MoveNext will not scheduled anyway .

Removed cefBrowser_InitializedChanged event handling because this actually had no use to the browser loading and being usable . Fixed the issue of the CEF Browser not loading the requested URL on connect . Changed the loading logic of the CEF Browser to wait for cefBrowser_LoadingStateChanged to trigger and to look at if it is still loading before logging that the browser is initialised . Altered cefBrowser_LoadingStateChanged to register itself as an event once the browser is loaded as we don ' t care for any more events once we know it is safe to issue the Browser . Load ( ) method . Updated Connect to record when it has been requested so that if the browser initialises after this request , it can retrigger the code to load the required URL automatically . Removed the dispose code , though this might need to be reimplemented after testing . Updated App . config and . csproj with settings defined in CEF user documentation . Updated some of the CEF Settings to recommended values .
