Added some tests for the Database iterator interface . Updated the post - increment operator so that it forks off a copy of the LevelDB or LMDB iterator / cursor when necessary . Neither of these APIs allow you to directly copy an iterator or cursor , so I create a new iterator and seek to the key that the previous one was currently on . This means the pre - increment operator can be much cheaper than the post - increment operator .

Version number 1 . 37 WIP

Fixed scrollbar issue , followup to beda5fc5a0252b80ee16293afb80701807a33150 and 2df8fa95dfe3463ece78c56b02dc815c3e71331a .
Style : Added ButtonTextAlign , ImGuiStyleVar_ButtonTextAlign ( )
Examples : DirectX9 : save / restore some more device state .
Reworked Columns ( ) examples .
Examples : Tweaked the main . cpp example structure for all examples . ( There are a few hidden agendas here : 1 ) I would like to avoid encouraging people from using the implicit " Debug " window , and promote using Begin / End . In spite of my best attempt , there are a few feature of the upcoming docking system that cannot work 100 % properly for the implicit Debug window , so future proof let ' s not put that feature in the spotlight too much for new users . 2 ) Moved dumb hardcoded positions into a single spot that can be replaced with a viewport relative position and not affect other demo windows . 3 ) Calling ShowDemoWindow before anything else , also for the benefit of a specific docking demo which will have an ordering constraint which is not really problematic in a real app but shouldn ' t be put forward in the demo .

CalcTextSize * ( ) more optimisation , fast - path for ascii .
Renamed ColorEdit / ColorPicker ' s ImGuiColorEditFlags_RGB / _HSV / _HEX flags to respectively ImGuiColorEditFlags_DisplayRGB / _DisplayHSV / _DisplayHex . This is anticipation of adding new flags to ColorEdit / ColorPicker functions which would make those ambiguous . ( ) [ @ haldean ]
