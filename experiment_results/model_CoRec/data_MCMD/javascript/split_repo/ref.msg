Prevent IE from generating unwanted clicks on the body . When mousedown fires on the selection element and then mouseup fires on the mask ( because it is moved under the mouse during mousedown ) then IE fires a click event on the body because it is the closest common ancestor . To prevent this , we detach and reatach the elements on mousedown which cancels the click event .
