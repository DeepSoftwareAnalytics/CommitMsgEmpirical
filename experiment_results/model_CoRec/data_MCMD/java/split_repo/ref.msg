Decode JSON literal types eagerly and with our own decoder . Previously we relied on Double . parseDouble ( ) to decode tokens . Since that method is expensive , we deferred calling it unless absolutely necessary . Now we decode the literal type immediately . For efficiency we decode the token right out of the char buffer . This makes things more complicated but it saves many calls to charAt ( ) . It also opens up the possibility to deferring string creation .

Intermittent failure was due to Thread . sleep in the code . While performing unit test cases there was race condition between two threads , so it was not guaranteed to work every time .
